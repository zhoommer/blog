Choosing a text editor among developers has become less of a debate and more of a statement of identity.
While some remain loyal to the plugin-rich ecosystem of Visual Studio Code or the comprehensive features of JetBrains IDEs, I chose Neovim. In this article, I‚Äôll explain why I embraced Neovim and how it supports me in my daily workflow.

##### Minimalism and Fast Performance
Neovim offers a minimal structure. Instead of the many visual interface elements found in modern editors, it provides a pure and efficient text editing experience. As a result, Neovim runs much faster and is lightweight in terms of resource usage. You can write code effectively without overloading your computer‚Äôs resources.

##### Customizability
Another major advantage of Neovim is its fully customizable nature. You can shape your working environment with custom keybindings, color themes, and plugins to fit your needs. By using preconfigured plugin bundles like LazyVim, you can also save time on setup.

##### Productivity with LazyVim
LazyVim is a great tool that highlights Neovim‚Äôs customizability. It makes installing and using Neovim much easier. This is especially beneficial for developers who want to avoid complex configuration processes.

##### Fast Searching with Fzf
Neovim becomes even more powerful with plugins like Fzf (‚ÄúFuzzy Finder‚Äù), which allows for lightning-fast file and text searches. This can save a lot of time, especially in large projects, and helps you find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for in seconds.

##### Efficiency with Keyboard Shortcuts
Neovim‚Äôs keyboard shortcuts make the coding process much smoother. 
Here are some examples:
