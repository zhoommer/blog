        Welcome to My Frontend Dev Blog!
      </p>

      <p>

        This blog is dedicated to sharing everything I learn and use in my journey as a frontend developer. 

        Here, youâ€™ll find practical tips, tools, and tutorials about <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, and modern frameworks like React, Vue, NextJs and more. 

        Whether it's a handy trick, a tool that saved me hours, or insights from real-world projects, Iâ€™m here to pass it on.

        <b>Feel free to explore, learn something new, and join the conversation!</b>
